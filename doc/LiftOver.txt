How to liftover a hg19 gtf file to hg38?

First you need to use the UCSC liftover function (simple), but that is unfortunately not able to run on gtf or at least not on big gtf files.
Hence you need to convert your gtf file into a bed file meaning you loose most of the information.
A kind of good idea is to keep the gtf ids in the bed file.

The GTF_2_Bed.pl script does exactly that.
